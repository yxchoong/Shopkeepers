## Motivation

Ever been surprised to see a parcel delivered to your doorstep when you do not remember purchasing anything online recently? Otherwise, have you ever been quite sure that you have purchased something recently but cannot recall what it is or where you bought that particular product from?  It has come to our attention that many people have found it inconvenient to have to manually keep track of their online purchases, especially when they have bought many things online.  

With the advancement of technology, e-commerce is growing at an unprecedented rate and has been reshaping the retail landscape in all parts of the world. More and more online retail platforms have been emerging (eg Taobao and Shopee) and many retail stores also offer online purchases as well. As each platform only keeps track of purchases from their own stores, many shoppers might be too lazy to check each application/website one by one to track their online purchases. 

As such, we decided to come up with a 
#### website tracker.
With this tracker, one simply has to input the website/application and product they purchased and remind shoppers about the existence of the parcels. The tracker will also be able to show the estimated delivery time.  We decided to implement the tracker as a website as it is easily accessible, have a wider reach, better compatibility and is definitely cheaper to construct.  
 
## Aim

We hope to provide a webpage called the Shopkeepers where users can 
#### keep track of their individual online purchases.  
Our target audience is online shoppers.  The problem that many online shoppers face is that there is a 
#### lack of an individualized tracking system for online purchases. 
There are instances when people tend to forget what they bought online, and whether or not they have been delivered.  Hence, the main need that we hope to fulfil is to allow online shoppers to be able to keep track of everything purchased online.  We also want the web page to be user friendly so that it can be easily managed by all.
