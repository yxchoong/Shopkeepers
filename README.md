# Shopkeepers
## Team Name:
 
Shopkeepers. 
 
## Proposed Level of Achievement:
 
Project Gemini  
 
## Aim

We hope to provide a webpage called the Shopkeepers where users can **keep track of their individual online purchases**. Our target audience is online shoppers.  The problem that many online shoppers face is that there is a **lack of an individualized tracking system for online purchases**.
There are instances when people tend to forget what they bought online, and whether or not they have been delivered.  Hence, the main need that we hope to fulfil is to allow online shoppers to be able to keep track of everything purchased online.  We also want the web page to be user friendly so that it can be easily managed by all.

### Notification alert 
When the date has passed the supposed estimated day of arrival for an item, users will receive a notification (in the form of pop-up) so that they can expect the delivery.
If the status of the item is not updated (i.e to ‘delivered’) on the estimated day of delivery, another notification will be sent to remind users to update the status of the good or alert users about the late arrival of the good. In the event of late arrival, they may choose to call up the company to enquire about their good.
